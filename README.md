𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗩𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 (𝗦𝗩𝗠):
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification tasks, although it can also be used for regression (SVR - Support Vector Regression). The key idea behind SVM is to find a hyperplane (or decision boundary) that best separates the data into different classes. It aims to maximize the margin between the classes, meaning that it tries to create the largest possible gap between data points from different classes.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗦𝗩𝗠 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:
Linear SVM:
When the data is linearly separable, SVM will find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes.
The support vectors are the data points that are closest to the hyperplane and are critical in defining the hyperplane.

We have a small data of 768 patients as rows, 8 columns (features). Due to less computational power per system, the data is taken small but big data can be used on the same process.

𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 this ML SVM model gave a conclusion of patients that most patients are likely to have diabetes using features of Glucose, BMI, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Age, DiabetesPdigreeFunction, Insulin.
